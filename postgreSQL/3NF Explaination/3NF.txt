MOVIES TABLE

    the movies table adheres to 3NF because it has a primary key (movie_id), which
    is the only thing that each non primary-key attribute (title, release_year, genre, 
    director_name) depends on. there are no attributes that are dependant on eachother 
    (ex.. if you deleted the genre attribute, no others would be affected)

CUSTOMERS TABLE

    the customers table adheres to 3NF because there is a primary key (customer_id),
    and non primary-key attributes (first_name, last_name, email, phone_num) that
    depend on it and not eachother. (ex.. if email was deleted, phone_num would not
    be affected, it is only dependant on the customer which is identified by 
    customer_id)

RENTALS TABLE 

    the rentals table adheres to 3NF because there is a primary key (rental_id)
    and non-primary key attributes (customer_id, movie_id, rental_date, return_date)
    which are not dependant on eachother (ex.. if movie_id got deleted, rental_date
    would not be affected) but are dependant on the primary key rental_id.
